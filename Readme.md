# Reveal.js - Template

This simple **Reveal.js** template includes a header (left with text, right with logo) and a footer.

The template is based on the [VS-Code-reveal-plugin](https://github.com/evilz/vscode-reveal). 

Header and footer are taken from `Leftium`'s answer in [the corresponding stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34706859/set-header-and-footer-reveal-js-presentation).
